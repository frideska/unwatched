        <b class="uw_title">UnWatched</b> is a movie and TV series manager. The user can read news, add movies to their own watchlist
        and library, and see personal information and user statistics on their user page. Before logging in, the user is
        presented with the <i>Discover</i> page. From here the user can not access the <i>Library</i> nor the
        <i>Watchlist</i>, but they can use the <i>Search</i> functionality. To access the site, the user have to log into
        their Google account. <br/>
        The navigation bar presents the main pages. Here we will describe the <i>Discover</i> and <i>Search</i> first,
        since these are accessible functionalities while not logged in, then the logged in functionalities as
        <i>Library</i>, <i>Watchlist</i> and <i>Profile</i>.

        <ul class="list_ul uk-list">
          <li>
            <b class="li_item_title">Discover</b><br/>
            This page presents the user with news regarding new movies or series. The main module is the slide show, which
            presents a picture of a new(ish) movie or series, and gives a description of it. The two modules below, one for
            movies and one for series. The slide show offers browsing, left and right, and will browse automaticly if not
            hovered on.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b class="li_item_title">Search</b><br/>
            The search bar lets the user search for any movie or series they want. After searching, one can add the movie
            or series to their <i>Watchlist</i>, if the user want to see it later, or the user can add it to their
            <i>Library</i>, if they have seen it before. If the user clicks on a card, an extended view will pop up.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b class="li_item_title">Library</b><br/>
            The library contains all movies and shows the user has added to the library. This is meant as a representation
            of what movies or series the user has watched in the past. The user can toggle between <b>list view</b> and
            <b>grid view</b>. The user can also <b>filter</b> the library for movies or series, and one can <b>sort</b> the
            filtered movies or series by name, rating and date (year released).<br/>
            There is also a search functionality in the library, where one can filter and sort by the same parameters.
            If the user clicks on a card, an extended view will pop up.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b class="li_item_title">Watchlist</b><br/>
            The watchlist is basically the same as the library. This is meant as a collection of movies and series the user
            <i>want</i> to watch in the future. As the library, the watchlist also offers the same filtering and sorting as
            the library do. If the user clicks on a card, an extended view will pop up.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b class="li_item_title">Profile</b><br/>
            The user page offers information about when the user first joined and the ast time logged in. The
            <i>Average Rating</i> component calculates the average rating from both movies and series from the users
            library. The word clouds gives statistics over the user's favourite genres and desires. <i>Favourites</i> is calculated
            by only library, and <i>Desires</i> is calculated from both library and watchlist. Note: The word-cloud needs 5 or more
            movies or series in the watchlist/library to generate. So please add a dozen movies or series to get full
            functionality. The word cloud is boring with few things.<br/>
            The last thing on the user page is the <i>Curiosity history</i>. This component will store instances where the
            user clicks on a movie or series, and opens the extended view.
