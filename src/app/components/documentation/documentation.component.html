        <b class="uw_title">UnWatched</b> is a movie and TV series manager. The user can read news, add movies to their own watchlist
        and library, and see personal information and user statistics on their user page. To accsess the main functions the user have
        to be logged in. When logged in the user can access the <i>Library</i>, the <i>Watchlist</i>, and their <i>Profile</i>
        as well as the <i>Search</i> and <i>Discover</i> functionality. Here we will describe the <i>Discover</i> and <i>Search</i> first,
        since these are accessible functionalities while not logged in, then the logged in functionalities as
        <i>Library</i>, <i>Watchlist</i> and <i>Profile</i>.
      </p>

      <ul class="list_ul uk-list">
        <li>
          <b class="li_item_title">Discover</b><br/>
          This page presents the user with news regarding new movies and series. The main module is the slide show, which
          presents a picture of a new(ish) movie or series, and gives a description of it. The two modules below, one for
          movies and one for series. The slide show offers browsing, left and right, and will browse automaticly if not
          hovered on.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b class="li_item_title">Search</b><br/>
          The search bar lets the user search for any movie or series they want. After searching, one can add the movie
          or series to their <i>Watchlist</i>, if the user want to see it later, or the user can add it to their
          <i>Library</i>, if they have seen it before. If the user clicks on a card, an extended view will pop up.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b class="li_item_title">Library</b><br/>
          The library contains all movies and shows the user has added to the library. This is meant as a representation
          of what movies or series the user has watched in the past. The user can toggle between <b>list view</b> and
          <b>grid view</b>. The user can also <b>filter</b> the library for movies or series, and one can <b>sort</b> the
          filtered movies or series by name, rating and date (year released).<br/>
          There is also a search functionality in the library, where one can filter and sort by the same parameters.
          If the user clicks on a card, an extended view will pop up.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b class="li_item_title">Watchlist</b><br/>
          The watchlist is basically the same as the library. This is meant as a collection of movies and series the user
          <i>want</i> to watch in the future. As the library, the watchlist also offers the same filtering and sorting as
          the library do. If the user clicks on a card, an extended view will pop up.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b class="li_item_title">Profile</b><br/>
          The user page offers information about when the user first joined and the last time logged in. The
          <i>Average Rating</i> component calculates the average rating from both movies and series from the users
          library. The word clouds gives statistics over the user's favourite genres and desires. <i>Favourites</i> is calculated
          by only library, and <i>Desires</i> is calculated from both library and watchlist. Note: The word-cloud needs 5 or more
          movies or series in the watchlist/library to generate. So please add a dozen movies or series to get full
          functionality. The word cloud is boring with few things.<br/>
          The last thing on the user page is the <i>Curiosity history</i>. This component will store instances where the
          user clicks on a movie or series, and opens the extended view.

    <!--Description of how we have solved the project requirments-->
    <div>
      <h3>Project requirments</h3>
      <ul class="list_ul uk-list">
        <li>
          <b class="li_item_title">The web-application</b><br/>
          The project runs on the group's virtual machine and uses node.js on the server-side.
          We started developing the web-application in Angular version 4, but we jumped over to version 5, when it came out.
          We also used the user interface library UIkit for developing our project.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b class="li_item_title">Backend and database</b><br/>
          Out nodejs/express server is made to be highly modular and expandable with functionality mostly diveden in its own files.
          We chose PostgreSQL as our database of choice, with Sequelize as our ORM (Object Relational Mapper).
          This is because it makes relational queries very easy, and lets us do things fast.
          We started with using MongoDB with Mongoose, but found out our needs were better suited with a SQL database.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b class="li_item_title">Writing and reading to the database and search</b><br/>
          Our web-application demonstrate both writing and reading to the database.
          We have chosen to use TMDB as our API. By extracting data from here, we have implemented
          dynamic user-defined selection by letting users search through the data.
          The backend caches all used movie and series objects to the database to not tax the TMDb api too much.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b class="li_item_title">List based view</b><br/>
          Our list based view is implemented both in <i>Library</i> and <i>Watchlist</i> where the user can see
          the movies and series they have added in different ways. The user will have the option to choose between
          a less detailed list view and a more detailed “card” view. So the user can search in the less details list
          view and see all their added movies and series. They can also get more details by clicking one of the items
          in the list, and the list will expand. If the user clicks on a card, they will also be able to see the item
          in a separate window with more details
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b class="li_item_title">Sorting</b><br/>
              The list based view can also be sorted on “name”, “rating” and “date”. By clicking one of the buttons
              the user can choose between descending and ascending order for the items to be shown.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b class="li_item_title">Filtering</b><br/>
              The list can also be filtered on movies and series. If a user search for something in the list, they can
              choose between searching for movies and series. The user also have the option of filtering by popularity.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b class="li_item_title">Dynamic data loading</b><br/>
              Dynamic data loading is handled with pages.
              This is a feature supported by our database, and works really well with how PostgreSQL queries are done with Sequelize.
              Our services store page numbers and loads dynamically from the API seemlessly.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b class="li_item_title">"My page" functionality</b><br/>
          Our “my page” is the <i>Profile</i> page for the users when they are logged in. A user can log in and will then
          automatically end up here, where the user can see their last visits and more. This is described in detail over.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b class="li_item_title">"Session" handling</b><br/>
          Out sessions are handled by express, passport and cookies. We use hte Passport library to handle Oauth 2 login with Google. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <b class="li_item_title">Alternative view</b><br/>
          Our alternative “fancy” view is a word cloud of genres of the movies and series that you have watched
          the most (<i>Library</i>), and genres of the movies and series you want to watch (<i>Watchlist</i>). We have also implemented
          the word cloud view on the “not found” page.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b class="li_item_title">Testing</b><br/>
          For testing we are using Karma with Jasmine.
